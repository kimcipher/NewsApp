        <p>In skeleton, sled-riders zoom headfirst along an oval-shaped ice track. They reach incredible speeds. You might think that the name of the event comes from how dangerous it is, but the real answer is less spooky. When the sport began, skeleton sleds were made from wood planks. They looked kind of bony, like a skeleton. Today, skeleton sleds are sleek and made of fiberglass. They even have handles.
            Bob Barney is an Olympic historian. He remembers the original wooden sleds. They really could look like skeletons, he said.
            Hat Trick.A hat trick is a hockey term. It means a set of 3 goals made in a single game by a single player. But hockey players wear helmets, not hats. So where does this phrase come from?.Kory Stamper is a word expert with the dictionary company Merriam-Webster. In a video, he explained that American hockey stole this bit of sports slang from cricket. Cricket is a British sport that is related to baseball. In cricket, there is a bowler, who is like a pitcher, and batsmen, who are like batters. It is extremely hard for a bowler to strike out three batsmen from the other team in a row. Back in the old days, cricket teams would give their bowlers a gift for this achievement. Often, the prize would be a nice hat!......</p>

        <h2> Opinion: Real sports can learn a lesson from e-sports</h2>
        <img src="https://nails.newsela.com/s3/newsela-media/article_media/2018/01/elem-opinion-are-esports-real-sports-5b128a42.jpg?crop=0,73,1366,841&height=497&width=885"/></div>
        <p>The Washington Post newspaper says "e-sports" are attracting a large audience around the world. This latest sports craze, though, is not even a sport. It is video gaming.
            In e-sports, players and teams compete in video game tournaments. Fans fill arenas and watch the action live on huge screens.
            E-sports has gone way past kids playing against each other at home. The International is a major competition for players of the game Dota 2. Overwatch is another popular video game in e-sports. Earlier this year, the International awarded $24 million in prizes. The winner took home almost $11 million. Other e-sports tournaments have sold out Madison Square Garden in New York and the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Both arenas can seat 20,000 people.
            And e-sports aren't a big hit just in the United States. More than 80,000 fans attended an e-sports competition at the Olympic Stadium in Beijing, China. </p>

            <h2> Why sports history is American history</h2>
            <img src="https://nails.newsela.com/s3/newsela-media/article_media/2018/02/gl-history-Why-Sports-History-Is-American-History-c554159d.jpg?crop=0,81,1508,929&height=497&width=885"/></div>
        <p>Sports helped shape American life. For many years, it showed the racism and sexism in American society. But sports also gave immigrants and African-Americans a way to get a better life.
            Waves of immigrants have come to the United States from all around the world. In the past, many were not allowed to get into the nation's top schools and businesses. Often, sports were a way for talented young immigrants to make a better life for themselves.
            More than 60 years ago, Irish, Italian and Jewish Americans were often looked down on. They were not seen as truly American. At the same time, boxers John L. Sullivan, Jim Corbett, Benny Leonard and Rocky Marciano and baseball players Joe DiMaggio and Hank Greenberg all became huge stars. These athletes came from immigrant families. They offered hope that people like them could be successful and get accepted.
            I grew up during the 1950s in Brooklyn, New York. In my neighborhood, called Crown Heights, almost everyone was Jewish or Italian. The older generation spoke little or no English. For many neighborhood boys like me, sports were very important. Watching sports made us feel more American. We closely followed the three New York baseball teams. We watched football on Sundays and boxing matches on Friday nights.</p>
